Abstract: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

Abstract

This study explores the efficacy of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a powerful type of recurrent neural network, for predicting stock prices. Leveraging historical stock data, including features such as open, high, low, close prices, and volume, the LSTM model learns complex temporal patterns and long-term dependencies inherent in financial time series. The model is trained and evaluated using [mention your dataset source and stock ticker] data, employing techniques like data normalization and feature engineering to optimize performance..

Technologies Used:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A specialized RNN architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.

Deep Learning Frameworks: Libraries like TensorFlow or Keras for implementing and training the LSTM network, providing efficient numerical computation and automatic differentiation.

Data Manipulation and Preprocessing: Tools like Pandas and NumPy for data loading, cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the stock data for model input.

Performance Evaluation Metrics: Metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R-squared to assess the accuracy and generalization ability of the trained model.

Visualization Tools: Libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizing training and validation curves, as well as plotting predicted vs. actual stock prices to gain insights into model performance.

Conclusion:

The developed LSTM model demonstrates [mention your key findings, e.g., promising/limited ability] in predicting future stock prices, achieving [mention your achieved performance on key metrics]. The results highlight the potential of LSTM networks in capturing the complexities of the stock market, while also underscoring the challenges associated with predicting a highly volatile and often unpredictable domain. Further refinements, such as incorporating sentiment analysis, alternative data sources, or more sophisticated trading strategies, could potentially enhance the model's predictive accuracy and practical applicability for financial forecasting and decision-making.
